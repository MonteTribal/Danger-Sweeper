A Small stand-alone game. Made in Python 3.1. The game never ends, only gets harder. All levels are randomly generated, and are verified to be solvable by being checked with a basic search function (depth first search).

Your objective is to get from the top left of the screen to the bottom right. You start on the square with the number of your current level, and your target contains the number of the next level. There is a mine field between you and your goal. 

Controls:
- Arrow Keys - to move your cursor (Purple outline around square) around the board.
- Space - Reset level, and generate a new mine field.
- ESC - quit level
- Left Shift - cheat - show location of all bombs

WIP:
- Use mouse to put an 'X' over a square as a reminder to not step there.
